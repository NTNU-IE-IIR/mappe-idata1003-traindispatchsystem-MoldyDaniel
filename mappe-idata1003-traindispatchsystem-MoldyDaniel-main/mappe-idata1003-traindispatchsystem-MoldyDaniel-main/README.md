## Project description

[//]: # (TODO: Write a short description of your project/product here.)
With this Project I am creating a program that will keep track over train departure times while the program is also able to update the departures if there are delays.
The program will also be able to add new trains to the list of departures and remove trains from the list of departures.
The program will also be able to print out the list of departures in a nice format.
