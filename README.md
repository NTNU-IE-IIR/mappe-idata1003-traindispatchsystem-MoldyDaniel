## Project description

[//]: # (TODO: Write a short description of your project/product here.)
This project aims to develop a train departure tracking system capable of managing and updating train departure schedules, 
handling delays, adding new trains, and removing existing trains from the departure list. 
The program ensures accurate tracking of train schedules and offers user-friendly functionalities to interact with the departure system.
## Project structure

[//]: # (TODO: Describe the structure of your project here. How have you used packages in your structure. Where are all sourcefiles stored. Where are all JUnit-test classes stored. etc.)
The project is structured with 3 packages. 
* The first package is called "edu.ntnu.stud.entity". This package contains the class called "Train" and the class called "Clock".
* The second package is called "edu.ntnu.stud.logic". This package contains the class called "TrainRegister" and the class called "TrainDispatchApp".
* The third package is called "edu.ntnu.stud.ui". This package contains the class called "TrainDispatchAppUI".

The source files are stored in the src folder. The JUnit-test classes are stored in the test folder.
These test classes are called "TrainRegisterTest", "TrainTest" and "ClockTest".

## How to run the project

[//]: # (TODO: Describe how to run your project here. What is the main class? What is the main method? What is the input and output of the program? What is the expected behaviour of the program?)
The main class is called the TrainDispatchSystem and the main method is called main.
The input of the program is the user input and the output of the program is the user interface.
The expected behaviour of the program is to display the user interface and to handle the user input.

## How to run the tests

[//]: # (TODO: Describe how to run the tests here.)
You can either start the TrainDispatchApp class or run each test individually by right-clicking on the test class and select "Run 'TestClassName'".

## References

[//]: # (TODO: Include references here, if any. For example, if you have used code from the course book, include a reference to the chapter.Or if you have used code from a website or other source, include a link to the source.)
